# Fun facts

A simple REST API, made mainly for Twitch streamer [Salinono](https://twitch.tv/salinono), that will display a random fact in chat.

## Prepare for run

To install all dependencies that are in the package.json file

`npm install [package]`

After running this command you will also need to make a .env file and put in your own options. Refer to the .env.example for more.

## To run the app in a dev environment

`npm run dev`

This uses nodemon which is something you would need to have installed globally as well. To do so just simply run

`npm i -g nodemon`

## To run the app in a production environment

`npm run start`

This uses the default node.
